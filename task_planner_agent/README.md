# Workout Planner Agent
The Workout Planner Agent helps users plan a workout session. It breaks down the amount of time a user wants to put in, and breaks a session into workout steps and their timeline. 

The agent should:
* Asks the user for input. i.e."Plan a 1-hour workout session."
* Breaks down the workout into smaller steps (e.g., warm-up, main exercise, cool-down).
* Assigns a time durations to each step.
* Returns the plan to the user in a clear format.
